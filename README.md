# Welcome to Amazin' Amazim Storybook

## A React Amazon (& Netflix & ...) Clone Project

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components.
This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

## What is [Amazin' Amazim Storybook][amazin-story]

This is the collection of components that I wrote for [amazim.store][amazim], includes

- Buttons
- Input
- Rating
- Pagination
- MessageBox
- Cards
- And more to come ..

## What is Amazim?

This is not only an online shop/platform/clone of Amazon, Netflix or something else built with a js-framework,
but also a long term example experimenting some **modern**, **real-world**, **maybe unstable** React APIs, Nx, Mobile friendly PWA and also some Backend technologies in my spare time.

## Learning by Doing

**"Divide to conquer"** - Lao Tsu (604-531 BC).

When I look at the application, it is **huge**. When the task is huge, you usually don't know how to start working with them.
I had to break the big task into smaller parts, do it step by step and enjoy learning.

Yes, **Learning by Doing** that's my approach. If you see a long path ahead, don't heap or run or give up, just divide the path(process) to steps and make (conquer) the first one, and then another one.
I learned a lot of stuff, also renew and update my knowledge just by doing. You might too have a curiosity about the process of building the same scale app as well, but just let's do it.
